# GH4ST

Based on the __original ghost AI__ from the Pac-Man arcade.

## Meet Pac-Man

Pac-Man wants fruit, but is aghast in the face of ghosts.
Press "1" to allow your ghost to step forward.
(Pac-Man will wait for his turn to move.)

## No turning back

Let's lock our ghost up to study Pac-Man's behavior first.

Even though Pac-Man wants his fruit, he can't turn back
and is forced to take the long way.  Your ghost suffers
the same, but both can turn around if at a dead-end.

Press "1" to cycle your turn to see Pac-Man move.

## Follow your nose

Pac-Man follows his nose, but unfortunately he can smell the fruit through the
walls.  So, he'll take a wrong turn if it smells better than the others.

Remember he can't turn back, unless at a dead end!

Press "1" to see him eventually get there.  Press "Z" to rewind.

## Decisions, decisions

Pac-Man doesn't flip coins, so when he can't decide which turn smells better,
he chooses in the following clockwise order: UP, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT.

Press "1" to see him favor the RIGHT turn.

## Release the Ghost!

Meet Blinky, your first ghost.  He behaves exactly like Pac-Man, except he
prefers fruit of the Pac-Man variety :)

Press "1" to cycle Blinky until he inevitably catches Pac-Man.

## Blinky needs help

Here you can see that Blinky has no hope of catching Pac-Man here.
His behavior simply won't allow him to.

Press "1" to cycle to the inevitable defeat.

## Pinky can help

Meet Pinky, your second ghost!  You'll now have a choice of which ghost to move
on each turn.

Press "2" to move Pinky, or "1" to move Blinky.

## Pinky is different

Pinky actually doesn't chase Pac-Man like Blinky does.  Instead, he tries to
get ahead of him by aiming two tiles ahead of where Pac-Man is looking.
This doesn't always work out, as you can see here...

Press "2" to move Pinky.

## Work together

Though neither of them can catch Pac-Man on their own here, Pinky and Blinky
can accomplish a lot if you make them work together.

Press "1" to move Blinky, or "2" to move Pinky.

## Oh Clyde

Meet your third ghost, Clyde!  He chases Pac-Man directly, but unlike Blinky,
he gets scared when he's too close and tries to make off in the opposite
direction.

Press "3" to see Clyde choke.

## Well done Clyde

Clyde, like the others, cannot turn back to reach his target, so he is known to
accidentally run into Pac-Man if he can't get away in time.

Press "3" to move the unstoppable Clyde.

## Blinky and Clyde

## Pinky and Clyde

## Too easy

All of them

## Wait a minute

## Inky: Blinky's secret weapon
