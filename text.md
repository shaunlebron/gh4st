# GH4ST

Based on the actual ghost AI of the Pac-Man arcade.

## Meet Pac-Man

Pac-Man wants fruit, but is aghast in the face of ghosts.
Press "Q" to allow your ghost to step forward.
(Pac-Man will wait for his turn to move.)

## No turning back

Let's lock our ghost up to study Pac-Man's behavior first.

Even though Pac-Man wants his fruit, he can't turn back
and is forced to take the long way.  The ghost suffers
the same, but both can turn around if at a dead-end.

Press "Q" to cycle your turn to see Pac-Man move.

## Follow your nose

Pac-Man follows his nose, but unfortunately he can smell the fruit through the
walls.  So, he'll take a wrong turn if it smells better than the others.

Remember he can't turn back, unless at a dead end!

Press "Q" as before to see him go.  Press "Z" to rewind.

## Decisions, decisions
